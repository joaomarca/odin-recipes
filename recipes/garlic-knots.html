    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in 
                a bowl; mix to combine.</li>

            <li>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead 
                dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. Add more flour 
                (1 teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.</li>
            
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet 
                with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            
            <li>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges 
                of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots. 
                Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 
                minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley 
                for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.</li>
        </ol>
