    <!-- <h1>How to make lasagna</h1>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth 
        the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step 
        instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    
    <h2><br>Lasagna ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean 
            ground beef.</li>

        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the 
            meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of 
            tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>

        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance 
            the flavor of the sauce.</li>

        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh 
            parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, 
            and black pepper.</li>

        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>

        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna 
            extra decadent.</li>

        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the 
            lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><br>How to make lasagna step-by-step</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade 
        lasagna:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><br>How to layer lasagna</h2>
    <p>The detailed instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is 
        the order you'll folow:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarela slices</li>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><br>How long to cook lasagna</h2>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven 
        preheated to 375 degrees F.<br>Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, 
        then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes.<br>Also, it's important 
        to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before 
        you cut into it.</p>

    <h2><br>How to reheat lasagna</h2>
    <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or 
        short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the 
        noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover 
        the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an 
        hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.</p>

    <h2><br>How to freeze lasagna</h2>
    <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking 
        dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least 
        one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent 
        freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.</p>

    <h2><br>How to reheat frozen lasagna</h2>
    <p>Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the 
        reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, 
        you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the 
        cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.</p>

        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
            medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 
            1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles 
            in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold 
            water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
            baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping 
            slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 
            of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over 
            mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
            spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
            an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
